##  Key Features Implemented

### 1.  Collaborative Filtering
- **User-Based CF**: Recommends based on similar users' preferences
- **Item-Based CF**: Recommends based on similar items
- **Matrix Factorization**: SVD-based approach for better scalability
- **Surprise Library Integration**: Advanced CF algorithms (SVD, KNN)

### 2.  Content-Based Filtering
- **Genre-Based Recommendations**: Uses movie genre features
- **TF-IDF Similarity**: Text-based similarity using movie titles and genres
- **User Profile Creation**: Builds user preferences from rating history
- **Movie-to-Movie Recommendations**: Find similar movies based on content

### 3.  Hybrid System
- **Weighted Hybrid**: Combines CF and CB with configurable weights
- **Switching Hybrid**: Uses different methods based on user characteristics
- **Mixed Hybrid**: Takes top recommendations from both systems
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Real-time weight optimization

### 4.  Comprehensive Evaluation
- **Precision@K**: Measures relevance of top-K recommendations
- **Recall@K**: Measures coverage of relevant items
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **MAP (Mean Average Precision)**: Ranking quality assessment
- **NDCG**: Position-aware ranking evaluation
- **Coverage Analysis**: Catalog coverage and diversity metrics

### 5.  Interactive Applications
- **Streamlit Web App**: Full-featured web interface
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis and experimentation
- **Command-Line Interface**: Main script with interactive demo
- **Demo Mode**: Works without requiring the full dataset

##  Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- **Robust Data Loading**: Handles MovieLens 100k dataset format
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, and feature extraction
- **Sparse Matrix Handling**: Efficient user-movie matrix operations
- **Feature Engineering**: Genre encoding and text processing

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Cosine Similarity**: For user and item similarity calculations
- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**: Matrix factorization
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Text feature extraction
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Collaborative filtering with Surprise
- **Custom Similarity Metrics**: Optimized for recommendation tasks

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: Streamlit caching for faster web app performance
- **Vectorized Operations**: NumPy and Pandas optimizations
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large matrices
- **Parallel Processing**: Ready for multi-core implementations

##  Expected Performance Metrics

Based on the implementation and typical MovieLens 100k results:

- **Collaborative Filtering RMSE**: ~0.94
- **Content-Based Precision@5**: ~0.15-0.25
- **Hybrid System Improvement**: 10-20% over individual methods
- **Coverage**: 60-80% of catalog can be recommended
- **Diversity**: Balanced between popular and niche content
